    <hr>
    <p>I'm Vardhan Adhelli, a passionate and driven final-year B.Tech student from VVP Engineering College (VVPiet), with a strong foundation in software development. After completing a diploma post-10th grade, I’ve continuously advanced my technical skills, especially in front-end development, Java, and full-stack technologies.

I’ve built several practical projects, including an e-commerce website and a food ordering platform inspired by Swiggy and Zomato. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Microsoft Office tools like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I was recently selected for a Java Full Stack Development role through Pentagon Space's Campus Incubation Drive 2025.</p>
